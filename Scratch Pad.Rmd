## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(MASS)
```
```{r}
model = glm(`PCOS (Y/N)` ~ ., data = train_2, family = "binomial") %>%
  stepAIC(trace = FALSE)

```
```{r}
summary(model)
```
```{r}
colnames(train)
```
```{r}
train_2 = train %>%
  dplyr::select(-c("Weight (Kg)", "Waist(inch)", "Hip(inch)", "Waist:Hip Ratio", "Height(Cm)", "Marraige Status (Yrs)"))
```

```{r}
pchisq(model$deviance - sig_feat_model2_test$deviance, model$df.residual - sig_feat_model2_test$df.residual, lower.tail = F)
```
```{r}
pchisq(model$deviance, model$df.residual, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
